# Red Black Trees

## Description
This project implements a standard Red-Black Tree (RB Tree) to practically apply the understanding of its structure, properties, and balancing mechanism. A Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where each node contains an extra bit for denoting the color of the nodeâ€”either red or black. The primary goal of this project is to provide a functional implementation of RB Trees, demonstrating its ability to maintain balanced height for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

## Key Features
- **Self-Balancing**: Ensures logarithmic height, making insertion, deletion, and lookup operations efficient.
- **Color Properties**: Implements and maintains the Red-Black Tree properties, ensuring correct re-balancing after each insertion and deletion.
- **Binary Search Tree**: Extends binary search tree functionality, combining it with color-based balancing.
- **Tree Operations**:
  - Insertion with re-balancing
  - Deletion with re-balancing
  - Searching for specific values
- **Visualization**: Capable of printing or visualizing the tree structure for educational purposes.

## Installation and Usage
1. Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
2. Run the `RB_trees.py` file using:
   ```bash
   python RB_trees.py
   ```

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For the implementation of the Red-Black Tree and its operations.
