## 1. **Performance Analysis Square Matrix Multiplication**
   - **Description**: Implements three different algorithms for square matrix multiplication: regular, recursive (divide and conquer), and Strassen's method. It includes an empirical analysis of the asymptotic running time of each.
   - **Technologies**: C++
   - [More Details](./Performance-Analysis-Square-Matrix-Multiplication/README.md)

## 2. **Red Black Trees**
   - **Description**: A standard Red-Black Tree implementation to practically apply the understanding of self-balancing binary search trees.
   - **Technologies**: Python
   - [More Details](./Red-Black-Trees/README.md)

## 3. **Machine Learning in Identifying Handwritten Digits**
   - **Description**: A comparative analysis of Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks for handwritten digit classification, using multiple datasets.
   - **Technologies**: Python, LaTeX (for report generation)
   - [More Details](./ML-Handwritten-Digits/README.md)

## 4. **BFS Maze Solver**
   - **Description**: Implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to solve mazes, ensuring the shortest path is found if solvable.
   - **Technologies**: C++
   - [More Details](./BFS-Maze-Solver/README.md)

## 5. **Neural Network & K-means Model**
   - **Description**: A custom-built neural network and K-means clustering model implemented from scratch in Python, with adjustable parameters and forward/backpropagation for the neural network.
   - **Technologies**: Python
   - [More Details](./Neural-Network-Kmeans/README.md)

## 6. **Randomly Built Binary Search Trees**
   - **Description**: Investigates the expected height of randomly built binary search trees (BST) and order statistic trees (OST) analyzes the time complexities associated with node insertion and deletion.
   - **Technologies**: C++, Python, LaTeX (for report generation)
   - **Description**: Investigates the expected height of randomly built binary search trees (BST) and order statistic trees (OST) analyzes the time complexities associated with node insertion and deletion.
